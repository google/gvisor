# Performance data

This directory holds the CSVs generated by the now removed benchmark-tools
repository. The new functionally equivalent
[benchmark-tools is available.][benchmark-tools]

In the future, these will be automatically posted to a cloud storage bucket and
loaded dynamically. At that point, this directory will be removed.
