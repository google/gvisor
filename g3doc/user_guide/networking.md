# Networking

[TOC]

gVisor implements its own network stack called [netstack][netstack]. All aspects
of the network stack are handled inside the Sentry — including TCP connection
state, control messages, and packet assembly — keeping it isolated from the host
network stack. Data link layer packets are written directly to the virtual
device inside the network namespace setup by Docker or Kubernetes.

Configuring the network stack may provide performance benefits, but isn't the
only step to optimizing gVisor performance. See the
[Production guide][Production guide] for more.

The IP address and routes configured for the device are transferred inside the
sandbox. The loopback device runs exclusively inside the sandbox and does not
use the host. You can inspect them by running:

```bash
docker run --rm --runtime=runsc alpine ip addr
```

## Network passthrough

For high-performance networking applications, you may choose to disable the user
space network stack and instead use the host network stack, including the
loopback. Note that this mode decreases the isolation to the host.

Add the following `runtimeArgs` to your Docker configuration
(`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) and restart the Docker daemon:

```json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "runsc": {
            "path": "/usr/local/bin/runsc",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--network=host"
            ]
       }
    }
}
```

## Disabling external networking

To completely isolate the host and network from the sandbox, external networking
can be disabled. The sandbox will still contain a loopback provided by netstack.

Add the following `runtimeArgs` to your Docker configuration
(`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) and restart the Docker daemon:

```json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "runsc": {
            "path": "/usr/local/bin/runsc",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--network=none"
            ]
       }
    }
}
```

## Egress traffic shaping (TBF)

gVisor can rate limit outbound sandbox traffic with a
[Token Bucket Filter (TBF)][tc-tbf] queueing discipline. TBF is modeled after
Linux's `tbf` qdisc and supports a single-rate bucket. It applies to
non-loopback NICs when using netstack; ingress and loopback traffic are not
shaped. The implementation lives in [pkg/tcpip/link/qdisc/tbf][tbf-source].

To enable TBF globally, add the following `runtimeArgs` to your Docker
configuration (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) and restart the Docker daemon. For
example, 100 Mbps is 12,500,000 bytes/sec:

```json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "runsc": {
            "path": "/usr/local/bin/runsc",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--network=sandbox",
                "--qdisc=tbf",
                "--qdisc-tbf-rate=12500000",
                "--qdisc-tbf-burst=1048576"
            ]
       }
    }
}
```

`--qdisc=tbf` selects TBF instead of the default FIFO qdisc.
`--qdisc-tbf-rate` is the sustained egress rate in bytes/sec.
`--qdisc-tbf-burst` is the bucket depth in bytes. After an idle period, up
to `qdisc-tbf-burst` bytes can transmit at line rate before throttling
engages; sustained throughput is bounded by `qdisc-tbf-rate`. Both flags
take plain integers; unlike Linux `tc(8)`, gVisor does not accept
unit-suffixed strings like `1mbit` or `1mbps`. Both `--qdisc-tbf-rate` and
`--qdisc-tbf-burst` are required when `--qdisc=tbf`; the sandbox refuses
to start otherwise. There is no universal default for either: rate is
policy and burst depends on the workload's MTU, GSO configuration, and
acceptable latency.

Per-sandbox overrides can be set via OCI runtime annotations from any client
that supports them, including Kubernetes pod annotations propagated by
containerd, Docker (`--annotation key=value`), podman, and a raw OCI bundle's
`config.json`.
The relevant keys are:

```
dev.gvisor.flag.qdisc: "tbf"
dev.gvisor.flag.qdisc-tbf-rate: "12500000"
dev.gvisor.flag.qdisc-tbf-burst: "1048576"
```

For example, on a Kubernetes pod:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    dev.gvisor.flag.qdisc: "tbf"
    dev.gvisor.flag.qdisc-tbf-rate: "12500000"
    dev.gvisor.flag.qdisc-tbf-burst: "1048576"
```

The `qdisc` annotation can only select TBF unless `--allow-flag-override` is
enabled; selecting `fifo` or `none` by annotation is rejected. The
`qdisc-tbf-rate` and `qdisc-tbf-burst` annotations can only lower or match the
runtime-configured values unless `--allow-flag-override` is enabled.

Operators using containerd can set per-runtime ceilings in the containerd
runtime configuration that annotations cannot exceed:

```toml
[runsc_config]
  qdisc-tbf-rate = "12500000"
  qdisc-tbf-burst = "1048576"
```

### Disable GSO {#gso}

If your Linux is older than 4.14.77, you can disable Generic Segmentation
Offload (GSO) to run with a kernel that is newer than 3.17. Add the
`--gso=false` flag to your Docker runtime configuration
(`/etc/docker/daemon.json`) and restart the Docker daemon:

> Note: Network performance, especially for large payloads, will be greatly
> reduced.

```json
{
    "runtimes": {
        "runsc": {
            "path": "/usr/local/bin/runsc",
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--gso=false"
            ]
       }
    }
}
```
