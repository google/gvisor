# Checkpoint/Restore

[TOC]

gVisor has the ability to checkpoint a process, save its current state in a
state file, and restore into a new container using the state file.

## How to use checkpoint/restore

Checkpoint/restore functionality is currently available via raw `runsc`
commands. To use the checkpoint command, first run a container.

```bash
runsc run <container id>
```

To checkpoint the container, the `--image-path` flag must be provided. This is
the directory path within which the checkpoint state-file will be created. The
file will be called `checkpoint.img` and necessary directories will be created
if they do not yet exist.

> Note: Two checkpoints cannot be saved to the same directory; every image-path
> provided must be unique.

```bash
runsc checkpoint --image-path=<path> <container id>
```

There is also an optional `--leave-running` flag that allows the container to
continue to run after the checkpoint has been made. (By default, containers stop
their processes after committing a checkpoint.)

> Note: All top-level runsc flags needed when calling run must be provided to
> checkpoint if --leave-running is used.

> Note: --leave-running functions by causing an immediate restore so the
> container, although will maintain its given container id, may have a different
> process id.

```bash
runsc checkpoint --image-path=<path> --leave-running <container id>
```

To restore, provide the image path to the `checkpoint.img` file created during
the checkpoint. Because containers stop by default after checkpointing, restore
needs to happen in a new container (restore is a command which parallels start).

```bash
runsc create <container id>

runsc restore --image-path=<path> <container id>
```

## How to use checkpoint/restore in Docker:

Currently checkpoint/restore through `runsc` is not entirely compatible with
Docker, although there has been progress made from both gVisor and Docker to
enable compatibility. Here, we document the ideal workflow.

Run a container:

```bash
docker run [options] --runtime=runsc <image>`
```

Checkpoint a container:

```bash
docker checkpoint create <container> <checkpoint_name>`
```

Create a new container into which to restore:

```bash
docker create [options] --runtime=runsc <image>
```

Restore a container:

```bash
docker start --checkpoint --checkpoint-dir=<directory> <container>
```

### Issues Preventing Compatibility with Docker

-   **[Moby #37360][leave-running]:** Docker version 18.03.0-ce and earlier
    hangs when checkpointing and does not create the checkpoint. To successfully
    use this feature, install a custom version of docker-ce from the moby
    repository. This issue is caused by an improper implementation of the
    `--leave-running` flag. This issue is fixed in newer releases.
-   **Docker does not support restoration into new containers:** Docker
    currently expects the container which created the checkpoint to be the same
    container used to restore which is not possible in runsc. When Docker
    supports container migration and therefore restoration into new containers,
    this will be the flow.
-   **[Moby #37344][checkpoint-dir]:** Docker does not currently support the
    `--checkpoint-dir` flag but this will be required when restoring from a
    checkpoint made in another container.
