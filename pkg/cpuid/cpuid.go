// Package cpuid provides basic functionality for creating and adjusting CPU
// feature sets.
//
// To use FeatureSets, one should start with an existing FeatureSet (either a
// known platform, or HostFeatureSet()) and then add, remove, and test for
// features as desired.
//
// For example: on x86, test for hardware extended state saving, and if
// we don't have it, don't expose AVX, which cannot be saved with fxsave.
//
//   if !HostFeatureSet().HasFeature(X86FeatureXSAVE) {
//     exposedFeatures.Remove(X86FeatureAVX)
//   }
package cpuid

// Feature is a unique identifier for a particular cpu feature. We just use an
// int as a feature number on x86 and arm64.
//
// On x86, features are numbered according to "blocks". Each block is 32 bits, and
// feature bits from the same source (cpuid leaf/level) are in the same block.
//
// On arm64, features are numbered according to the ELF HWCAP definition.
