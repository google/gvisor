// Package coverage provides an interface through which Go coverage data can
// be collected, converted to kcov format, and exposed to userspace.
//
// Coverage can be enabled by calling bazel {build,test} with
// --collect_coverage_data and --instrumentation_filter with the desired
// coverage surface. This causes bazel to use the Go cover tool manually to
// generate instrumented files. It injects a hook that registers all coverage
// data with the coverdata package.

// In Linux, a kernel configuration is set that compiles the kernel with a
// custom function that is called at the beginning of every basic block, which
// updates the memory-mapped coverage information. The Go coverage tool does not
// allow us to inject arbitrary instructions into basic blocks, but it does
// provide data that we can convert to a kcov-like format and transfer them to
// userspace through a memory mapping.
//
// Note that this is not a strict implementation of kcov, which is especially
// tricky to do because we do not have the same coverage tools available in Go
// that that are available for the actual Linux kernel. In Linux, a kernel
// configuration is set that compiles the kernel with a custom function that is
// called at the beginning of every basic block to write program counters to the
// kcov memory mapping. In Go, however, coverage tools only give us a count of
// basic blocks as they are executed. Every time we return to userspace, we
// collect the coverage information and write out PCs for each block that was
// executed, providing userspace with the illusion that the kcov data is always
// up to date. For convenience, we also generate a unique synthetic PC for each
// block instead of using actual PCs. Finally, we do not provide thread-specific
// coverage data (each kcov instance only contains PCs executed by the thread
// owning it); instead, we will supply data for any file specified by --
// instrumentation_filter.
//
// Note that we "consume", i.e. clear, coverdata when this function is run, to
// ensure that each event is only reported once.
//
// TODO(b/160639712): evaluate whether it is ok to reset the global coverage
// data every time this function is run. We could technically have each thread
// store a local snapshot against which we compare the most recent coverdata so
// that separate threads do not affect each other's view of the data.
