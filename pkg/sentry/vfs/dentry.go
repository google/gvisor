// Dentry represents a node in a Filesystem tree at which a file exists.
//
// Dentries are reference-counted. Unless otherwise specified, all Dentry
// methods require that a reference is held.
//
// Dentry is loosely analogous to Linux's struct dentry, but:
//
// - VFS does not associate Dentries with inodes. gVisor interacts primarily
// with filesystems that are accessed through filesystem APIs (as opposed to
// raw block devices); many such APIs support only paths and file descriptors,
// and not inodes. Furthermore, when parties outside the scope of VFS can
// rename inodes on such filesystems, VFS generally cannot "follow" the rename,
// both due to synchronization issues and because it may not even be able to
// name the destination path; this implies that it would in fact be incorrect
// for Dentries to be associated with inodes on such filesystems. Consequently,
// operations that are inode operations in Linux are FilesystemImpl methods
// and/or FileDescriptionImpl methods in gVisor's VFS. Filesystems that do
// support inodes may store appropriate state in implementations of DentryImpl.
//
// - VFS does not require that Dentries are instantiated for all paths accessed
// through VFS, only those that are tracked beyond the scope of a single
// Filesystem operation. This includes file descriptions, mount points, mount
// roots, process working directories, and chroots. This avoids instantiation
// of Dentries for operations on mutable remote filesystems that can't actually
// cache any state in the Dentry.
//
// - VFS does not track filesystem structure (i.e. relationships between
// Dentries), since both the relevant state and synchronization are
// filesystem-specific.
//
// - For the reasons above, VFS is not directly responsible for managing Dentry
// lifetime. Dentry reference counts only indicate the extent to which VFS
// requires Dentries to exist; Filesystems may elect to cache or discard
// Dentries with zero references.
