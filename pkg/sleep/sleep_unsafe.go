// Package sleep allows goroutines to efficiently sleep on multiple sources of
// notifications (wakers). It offers O(1) complexity, which is different from
// multi-channel selects which have O(n) complexity (where n is the number of
// channels) and a considerable constant factor.
//
// It is similar to edge-triggered epoll waits, where the user registers each
// object of interest once, and then can repeatedly wait on all of them.
//
// A Waker object is used to wake a sleeping goroutine (G) up, or prevent it
// from going to sleep next. A Sleeper object is used to receive notifications
// from wakers, and if no notifications are available, to optionally sleep until
// one becomes available.
//
// A Waker can be associated with at most one Sleeper, but a Sleeper can be
// associated with multiple Wakers. A Sleeper has a list of asserted (ready)
// wakers; when Fetch() is called repeatedly, elements from this list are
// returned until the list becomes empty in which case the goroutine goes to
// sleep. When Assert() is called on a Waker, it adds itself to the Sleeper's
// asserted list and wakes the G up from its sleep if needed.
//
// Sleeper objects are expected to be used as follows, with just one goroutine
// executing this code:
//
//	// One time set-up.
//	s := sleep.Sleeper{}
//	s.AddWaker(&w1, constant1)
//	s.AddWaker(&w2, constant2)
//
//	// Called repeatedly.
//	for {
//		switch id, _ := s.Fetch(true); id {
//		case constant1:
//			// Do work triggered by w1 being asserted.
//		case constant2:
//			// Do work triggered by w2 being asserted.
//		}
//	}
//
// And Waker objects are expected to call w.Assert() when they want the sleeper
// to wake up and perform work.
//
// The notifications are edge-triggered, which means that if a Waker calls
// Assert() several times before the sleeper has the chance to wake up, it will
// only be notified once and should perform all pending work (alternatively, it
// can also call Assert() on the waker, to ensure that it will wake up again).
//
// The "unsafeness" here is in the casts to/from unsafe.Pointer, which is safe
// when only one type is used for each unsafe.Pointer (which is the case here),
// we should just make sure that this remains the case in the future. The usage
// of unsafe package could be confined to sharedWaker and sharedSleeper types
// that would hold pointers in atomic.Pointers, but the go compiler currently
// can't optimize these as well (it won't inline their method calls), which
// reduces performance.
