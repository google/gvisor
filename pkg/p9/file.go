// for each method.

//
// none: There is no concurrency guarantee. The method may be invoked
// concurrently with any other method on any other file.
//
// read: The method is guaranteed to be exclusive of any write or global
// operation that is mutating the state of the directory tree starting at this
// node. For example, this means creating new files, symlinks, directories or
// renaming a directory entry (or renaming in to this target), but the method
// may be called concurrently with other read methods.
//
// write: The method is guaranteed to be exclusive of any read, write or global
// operation that is mutating the state of the directory tree starting at this
// node, as described in read above. There may however, be other write
// operations executing concurrently on other components in the directory tree.
//
// global: The method is guaranteed to be exclusive of any read, write or
// global operation.
