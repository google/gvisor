// timer is a timer implementation that reduces the interactions with the
// runtime timer infrastructure by letting timers run (and potentially
// eventually expire) even if they are stopped. It makes it cheaper to
// disable/reenable timers at the expense of spurious wakes. This is useful for
// cases when the same timer is disabled/reenabled repeatedly with relatively
// long timeouts farther into the future.
//
// TCP retransmit timers benefit from this because they the timeouts are long
// (currently at least 200ms), and get disabled when acks are received, and
// reenabled when new pending segments are sent.
//
// It is advantageous to avoid interacting with the runtime because it acquires
// a global mutex and performs O(log n) operations, where n is the global number
// of timers, whenever a timer is enabled or disabled, and may make a syscall.
//
// This struct is thread-compatible.
