// Package marshal defines the Marshallable interface for

// Marshallable represents a type that can be marshalled to and from memory.
type Marshallable interface {
	// SizeBytes is the size of the memory representation of a type in
	// marshalled form.
	SizeBytes() int

	// MarshalBytes serializes a copy of a type to dst. dst must be at least
	// SizeBytes() long.
	MarshalBytes(dst []byte)

	// UnmarshalBytes deserializes a type from src. src must be at least
	// SizeBytes() long.
	UnmarshalBytes(src []byte)

	// Packed returns true if the marshalled size of the type is the same as the
	// size it occupies in memory. This happens when the type has no fields
	// starting at unaligned addresses (should always be true by default for ABI
	// structs, verified by automatically generated tests when using
	// go_marshal), and has no fields marked `marshal:"unaligned"`.
	Packed() bool

	// MarshalUnsafe serializes a type by bulk copying its in-memory
	// representation to the dst buffer. This is only safe to do when the type
	// has no implicit padding, see Marshallable.Packed. When Packed would
	// return false, MarshalUnsafe should fall back to the safer but slower
	// MarshalBytes.
	MarshalUnsafe(dst []byte)

	// UnmarshalUnsafe deserializes a type directly to the underlying memory
	// allocated for the object by the runtime.
	//
	// This allows much faster unmarshalling of types which have no implicit
	// padding, see Marshallable.Packed. When Packed would return false,
	// UnmarshalUnsafe should fall back to the safer but slower unmarshal
	// mechanism implemented in UnmarshalBytes (usually by calling
	// UnmarshalBytes directly).
