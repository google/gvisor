##   The canonical test targets defined below will automatically load
##   relevant images. These can be loaded or built manually via these
##   targets.
##
##   (*) Note that you may provide an ARCH parameter in order to build
##   and load images from an alternate archiecture (using qemu). When
##   bazel is run as a server, this has the effect of running an full
##   cross-architecture chain, and can produce cross-compiled binaries.
